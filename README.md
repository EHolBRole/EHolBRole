## About Me

I enjoy building complex systems, from turn-based strategy games to utility applications, and continuously improving my coding skills and architectural thinking. I have hands-on experience designing and implementing gameplay systems, AI behaviors, and runtime data management, alongside solid knowledge of software design principles.

I am an effective communicator, comfortable explaining technical concepts to both peers and non-technical people, and have experience organizing and contributing in team projects.

I am actively seeking opportunities to grow as a developer, collaborate with others, and contribute my skills to exciting projects!
